# PetriNet_backend_API

A web server API that accepts a Petri net as input, executes its transitions, and streams its evolution (state changes) in real time via a WebSocket connection.

A demo of a client use is available on **[the webserver URL](https://petrinet-api-457dae2a7a71.herokuapp.com/)**. It displays the messages exchange and Petri net execution.

For more insights on how to use this API, please look at [index.html](./src/Flask_API/templates/index.html) 

This project is designed as the backend of a bigger one, in progress ([front website](https://rdp-project-front-hugues898s-projects.vercel.app))
